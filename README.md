## ReadMeGenerator

ReadMe Generator is a Node creation that questions a user on certain criteria and creates a README.md file based on the answers they provide.

Using the NPM Inquirer a user can use NODE on the file index.js (in folder develop) to create a README file using the template created in "generateMarkdown.js"

There are links to each section in a Table of Contents section as well as options for the top 3 used GitHub Licenses that will generate a license badge for the readme.

The following two screenshots will show you how the README is generated based on the questions given:

You can see below where each question shows up on the markdwon file. The table of contents contains links that will link a user to each section. The Questions section will take the email and github name that the user enters into contact links:
